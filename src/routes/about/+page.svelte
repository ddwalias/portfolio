		<p>
			I'm a software engineer based in Vietnam, currently building internal tools at
			<strong>AS White Global</strong>. I've been writing code professionally since 2022 — starting
			with outsourcing, and getting into product engineering, and recently doing a lot of open
			source.
		</p>

		<p>
			I've always liked working with computers. I started writing code in 10th grade. Ever since,
			I've been trying to learn as much as I can about computer science and software engineering. I
			mainly work professionally with ASP.NET and React on the web platform, but recently I'm also
			interested in system programming and have been learning Rust in my free time.
		</p>

		<p>
			I'm a big fan of open source. I've been contributing to open source projects for a few years
			now. I believe that open source is the future of software development.
		</p>

		<p>
			When I'm not at a screen, I'm probably making coffee, reading something about systems design,
			or convincing myself that my latest side project will be
			<span class="handwritten">the one I actually finish.</span>
		</p>

		<h2>Tools I reach for</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Rust</strong> - a huge things for me to get to know about system programming.</li>
			<li><strong>ASP.NET, React</strong> - for building website professionally.</li>
			<li><strong>SvelteKit</strong> - make me enjoy frontend development again.</li>
			<li><strong>TypeScript</strong> - this is a must have for me.</li>
			<li><strong>Postgres</strong> - my trusted database.</li>
		</ul>
